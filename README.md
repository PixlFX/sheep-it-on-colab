# sheep-it-on-colab
Simple notebook I wrote to get sheepit working on google colab. AFAIK it's within tos to use it like this.
Just download the notebook, upload it in Google Colab (colab.research.google.com). 
Run the first cell, enter your info in the second cell, and run the last cell to run sheepit.
